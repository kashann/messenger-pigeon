Good morning, cutie pie! Another day of thinking about you. Save me some good morning kisses... I'll take them later in person! 💕
Hope you are having a lovely day so far... May you find lots of reasons to smile today!
As I open my eyes to witness the beautiful sunshine, it feels like the warmth of your love is embracing me. Good morning my love.
What is love? It is what makes your cell phone ring every time I send text messages.
Mornings are beautiful, but they are especially satisfying when I get to wake up beside you and that sweet smile of yours. It's the best way to start the day.
I love every morning that you are with me. It makes me feel so close to you and so blessed in this life of ours.
Only the fortunate ones get the chance to wish their loved one a good morning when they wake up. I'm so lucky.
The beauty of the morning sunshine is nothing compared to your natural glow. You truly are the most gorgeous ever! 😍
You have no idea how much my heart races when I see you.
I love when I catch you looking at me.
You make me forget how to breathe.
Nobody is perfect, but you're so close it's scary 💕
All I need is you right here.
I wish every day you could see yourself the way I see you. Because I see you as absolutely perfect.
I love you more than I did yesterday but not more than I will tomorrow ❤️
The only time I stupidly smile at my phone is when I get text messages from you.
The best part of my day is your smile.
Being with you is the easiest choice I have ever made, and I'm so lucky I get to make it every day.
I love you more and more every day. 😍
I love your eyes, your passion, your hugs, your courage, your bravery, your partnership, your jokes, and your smile.
You're my soulmate, my best friend, my partner, and my confidante. Thank you for that.
I want to be your favorite hello and your hardest goodbye.
Your smile takes my breath away. It took my breath away on the day we met, on the day we dated the first time, today, and every day in between.
When I put my arms around you, I never want to let you go.
My life was black and white until you came in and added color.
If I were a stop light 🚦, I would turn red every time you passed by, so that I could stare at you a bit longer. 😍
I can't explain the way you make me feel when I hear your voice or see your face, but I adore it.
Just had to let you know…loving you is the best thing that happened to me 💕
If I could give you one thing in life, I'd give you the ability to see yourself through my eyes, only then would you realize how special you are to me.
I think you're cuter than any cat picture 🐈
If you were a movie, I'd watch you over and over again.
In a sea of people, my eyes always search for you.
I love you and I don’t want to lose you. Because my life has been better since the day I found out.
I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you.
You have bewitched me, body and soul, and I love, I love, I love you. I never wish to be parted from you from this day on.
No matter what has happened. No matter what you’ve done. No matter what you will do. I will always love you. I swear it.
If I had to choose between breathing and loving you I would use my last breath to tell you I love you.
You are the owner of my heart, my feelings, my soul and my body. I completely belong to you, baby. I love you. Always.
Come to my dreams if you can. I'll kiss you there.
Tonight I'll fall asleep with you in my heart.
You will be the last thing I think of before I fall to sleep and the first thing to remember when I wake up.
Every day I spend with you is the new best day of my life. Can't wait for the morning.
My days are worth it if I can end them with you by my side.
The brightest thing in this world are your eyes when you look at me. I don't want to see stars, but your eyes.
Sleeping is impossible when all I can think about is you. Good night! ❤️
Before I fall asleep, I always picture what it would feel like to fall asleep in eachother's arms. It's the best feeling in the world.
Every night I love coming back home. Because home is being in your arms. Good night.
Now really, good night to the love of my life! I hope you enjoyed my surprise 💕
